    In this subcategory, you will discover iterators and blocks in Ruby.

    select: Filters the elements of a collection according to a condition defined in a block of code and returns a new array with the elements that satisfy this condition.
    reject: Does the opposite of select, returning the elements that do not satisfy the condition.
      Example:
        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    A block is a piece of code passed to a method.
    Blocks can be defined with {} for short blocks or do...end for longer blocks.

    A hash is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. Unlike arrays, the elements of a hash are not ordered by numeric index but by keys.

      hash = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" }

      Accessing Values:
      hash[:key1]  # => "value1"

    Common Methods:
      keys: returns all the keys in the hash.
      values: returns all the values in the hash.
      each: iterates over each key-value pair.',

    A symbol is an immutable object often used as an identifier or key in a hash.
